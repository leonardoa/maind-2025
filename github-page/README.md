- Drag and drop your files into the page or use the upload function.
- After uploading, write a commit message describing what you are uploading.
- Click on "Commit changes".

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository settings (Settings).
- Scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Under "Source", select the branch where you uploaded your files, typically `main` or `master`.
- Click on "Save".
- GitHub will provide a URL, which will be the home of your site.

## Step 5: Test Your Site
- Open the URL provided by GitHub Pages on your phone to see how your site appears and how the sketches function.
- You can keep making changes to your files and push them to GitHub. Updates will appear by refreshing the page after a few minutes.
